        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Some user agents have split their viewport into two conceptual viewports, colloquially
            known as the <em>visual</em> and <em>layout</em> viewports. This separation is useful in
            enabling a user agent (UA) with a small screen to allow the user to zoom in on parts of the page
            without causing the page to respond, for example, by obscuring the user's view with
            <code>position: fixed</code> elements. As another example, mobile UAs often provide an <em>on-screen
                keyboard</em> (OSK) for user input. Without the visual/layout split, a <code>position: fixed</code>
            element would be pushed up when the OSK is shown, obscuring the user's view. Informally,
            the layout viewport is what the web page uses when laying out its UI while the visual viewport
            is the box on the page that the user can currently see, accounting for transient UI features like
            pinch-zoom and the OSK.
        </p>
        <p>
            The existing APIs provided by UAs are ambiguous about which viewport they're relative to. For
            example, <code>document.scrollingElement.scrollLeft</code> returns the scroll position of the
            visual viewport while <code>document.scrollingElement.clientWidth</code> returns the width of
            the layout viewport. <code>getBoundingClientRect</code> returns the rect relative to the layout
            viewport while positioning non-fixed elements relative to the layout viewport is difficult. This
            makes building UI that responds to scrolls across mobile and desktop UAs difficult. Worse still,
            there's no way for the developer to be notified when the visual viewport changes. For example,
            the only way to know when the user has zoomed is to poll or listen to touch events and continually
            check <code>window.innerWidth</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Visual Viewport API is designed to provide an explicit mechanism for developers to query and
            potentially modify the properties of the visual viewport. It also introduces events that allow the
            page to listen for changes in the visual viewport, allowing UX that explicitly wants to react to
            these changes to do so. For example, the page could keep a small text-formatting bar above the OSK.

            <h3>Definition of the visual viewport</h3>
            <p>
                The <dfn>visual viewport</dfn> is a kind of <dfn data-cite="!CSS22/visuren.html#x1">viewport</dfn> whose
                <dfn data-cite="!cssom-view-1/#scrolling-area">scrolling area</dfn> is
                another <a>viewport</a>, called the <dfn>layout viewport</dfn>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to scrolling, the <a>visual viewport</a> also allows
                applying a scale transform to its <a>layout viewport</a>. This
                transform is applied to the canvas of the <a>layout viewport</a>
                and does not affect its internal coordinate space.
            <div class="note">
                The scale transform on the visual viewport is sometimes
                referred to as "pinch-zoom". Conceptually, this transform
                changes the size of the CSS <a>reference pixel</a> but
                changes the size of the <a>layout viewport</a> proportionally
                so that it acts like a magnifying glass, without causing
                reflow of the page's contents.
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                The magnitude of the scale transform is known as the visual
                viewport's <dfn>scale factor</dfn>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a>window</a> object has an <dfn>associated</dfn> <a>visual viewport</a>
                which is a <a>VisualViewport</a> object. Every <a>visual
                    viewport</a> is associated with exactly one <a>window</a> object
                that never changes. The <dfn>associated document</dfn> of a <a>visual viewport</a>
                is the <a data-cite="!HTML#concept-document-window">associated document</a> of its <a>associated</a>
                window.

                A document being presented in any browsing context, including a
                nested browsing context, will have its own visual viewport.
                However, most user agents modify the visual viewport only on a
                top-level browsing context. The visual viewport in a nested
                browsing context is provided for ergonomic reasons.

                For example: if a script retains a reference to a <a>VisualViewport</a> for an iframe, then

                        A viewport segment represents the region of the visual viewport that resides on a separate
                        display or logical display region.
                        When the visual viewport spans across some number of physical features of a device, these
                        features in turn convey a logical separation of the space available for content.

                        <code>segments</code> is null when there is only a single viewport segment. Returns null when

                    Based on the data returned for each viewport segment, developers will be able to infer the number of

                    The browser window can be moved/resized such that the number of segments and/or their dimensions
                    change. In these cases, resize events will fire at which point authors should re-query this
                    property, as the returned FrozenArray is just a snapshot of the current state.
